Vertex usually without ivory spots. Upper lateral margin of pronotum black, at most hind angle with ivory spot. Malar space smaller, index < 1.0. Postpetiole moderately widened, its width 0.65-0.75 of the distance of the outer dentiparal angles (figs. 16-17). Flagellum with 30-38 segments, widened in the apical half, widest segments square or transverse. A very variable species (or probably a species-group).
TAXON= P. orbitalis (Gravenhorst, 1829)

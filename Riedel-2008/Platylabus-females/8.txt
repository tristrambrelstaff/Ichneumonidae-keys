8 Temples parallel or moderately narrowed behind the eyes (figs. 16-18, 24-25). Genae often swollen. Postpetiole moderately widened, its width not more than 0.85 of the distance of the outer dentiparal angles, with the dorsal carinae usually ± obsolete. Thyridia moderately large, index < 1.5, their interval usually not smaller than middle field of postpetiole. In most cases, tergites 2-4 of Metasoma entirely red. Vertex sometimes with ivory spots. ...................................................9
– Temples strongly, sometimes almost linearly narrowed (figs. 26-27). Genae not swollen. Postpetiole very strongly widened, its width at least 0.85 of the distance of the outer dentiparal angles, the dorsal carinae strong (figs. 26-27). Thyridia very large, index > 2.0, their interval much smaller than median field of postpetiole. Tergite 4 usually black. Vertex without ivory spots. .................................................................................. 14

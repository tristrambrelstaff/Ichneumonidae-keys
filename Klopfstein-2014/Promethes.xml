        Antenna orange or brown, long and slender, with 22 or more
        flagellomeres; first flagellomere more than 5 times as long
        as wide. Hind tibia orange or yellow, apex sometimes
        dark. Metasoma in females and often also in males marked

        Second metasomal tergite rugose, matt, wider than
        long. Mesopleuron distinctly punctate over most of its
        surface. Petiolar area of propodeum filled with
        carinulae. Females with metasoma dorsoventrally depressed to
        apex.

        Second metasomal tergite smooth and shining at least on
        apical half, basally with longitudinal wrinkles, longer than
        wide. Mesopleuron with punctures weak, distinct at most on
        lower half. Petiolar area of propodeum mostly smooth, with
        carinulae restricted to its margins. Females with metasoma
        laterally compressed.

        Scutellum with a large yellow blotch covering most of its
        surface. Mesoscutum with large yellow shoulder marks which
        usually expand over notauli. Basal area of propodeum usually
        more than 2.5 times wider than long, with apical carina
        often partly reduced (Fig. 22A).

        Scutellum usually black but sometimes marked with yellow on
        anterior part, especially in males. Mesoscutum without or at
        most with small yellow shoulder marks which do not expand
        over notauli. Basal area of propodeum usually less than 2
        times wider than long, with apical carina strong (Fig. 22B).

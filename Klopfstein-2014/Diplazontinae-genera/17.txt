17  Ovipositor sheaths broadly and transversely truncate, thus apically open; last visible sternite in females large and triangular (Fig. 15G). Hind tibia usually black with a white base (Figs 14B, 14C) but sometimes entirely black or orange with a dark apex. Clypeus usually flat or with a subbasal transverse impression which is often only present on lateral parts, clypeus thus convex or flat centrally but concave in cross section laterally (Fig. 16D). Tyloids on male antenna, if present, usually broad (Fig. 13I) ........................................................................................... 18
-   Ovipositor sheaths either pointed or rounded and closed apically (Fig. 15H), or diagonally truncate (Fig. 15I); last visible sternite, if triangular, then less conspicuous. Hind tibia mainly white, yellow or orange, often with apex dark. Clypeus various but often (genus Homotropus) with a preapical impression, rendering basal three-quarters convex (Fig. 16C). Tyloids on male antenna, if present, usually narrow (Fig. 13H) .............................................................. 19

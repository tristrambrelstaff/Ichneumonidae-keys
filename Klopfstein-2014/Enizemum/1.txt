Antenna with 20 to 22 flagellomeres in both sexes. Female antenna orange to reddish brown at least on basal segments, with multiporous plate sensilla present on entire antenna, although often sparser ventrally. Median dorsal carinae on first tergite very long, almost reaching posterior margin, converging over basal half of first tergite, then more or less parallel, thus forming a quite distinct angle (Fig. 14E). Mesosternum entirely black in females and black with yellow markings in males. Subtegular ridge usually black. Male mesopleuron black and yellow, without orange markings.
TAXON= Enizemum ornatum (Gravenhorst)

Antenna 23 to 25, rarely with 22 flagellomeres, usually dark brown, very rarely reddish brown. Female antenna apical flagellomeres ventrally often devoid of multiporous plate sensilla, covered with a short velvety pile (cf. Fig. 5). Median dorsal carinae on first tergite various, sometimes as described above, but often weak or even absent on posterior half, often converging over most of the tergite, thus not forming a quite distinct angle (cf. Fig. 14F). Mesosoma sometimes partly orange. Subtegular ridge usually marked with yellow. Male mesopleuron often orange below.

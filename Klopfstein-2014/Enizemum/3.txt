Median dorsal carinae on first tergite very long, almost reaching posterior margin, converging over basal half of first tergite, then more or less parallel, thus forming a quite distinct angle (cf. Fig. 14E). Propodeum with carinae around basal area at least indicated, less so in males. In females, ventral area of apical flagellomeres evenly covered with plate sensilla. Male face entirely yellow, mesopleuron orange on at least lower half.
TAXON= Enizemum scutellare (Lange)

Median dorsal carinae on tergites 1 and 2 often partly reduced, usually converging about three quarters or less of the tergite length, and more evenly and roundedly converging towards each other (cf. Fig. 14F). Propodeum often without any indication of basal area. Female antenna with ventro-apical area devoid of plate sensilla but with a short velvety pile (cf. Fig. 5). Mesopleuron with orange colouration usually absent or more restricted.
